The player is tasked with renovating an abandoned warehouse and turning it into an animal rescue shelter. You can play either solo or co-op.</p><p data-block-id="b275bd2d-fdb1-4969-a1c6-c8b95955b70b">The animals are also extremely cute!</p><h3 data-block-id="ea2a89d2-d307-47c0-a1be-ee935c993373">Plot</h3><p data-block-id="4fd513f7-b3dc-4c30-9d5b-9f4802e4002c">There's no real story in the game. You start the game having just taken over a decrepit warehouse. Your job is to clean out all the junk, restore it and get to rescuing cats and dogs!</p><p data-block-id="7f1311b3-53a3-44ae-8546-fdba480a7518">Send out a car to collect reported strays or abandoned pets. Help the animals settle in and treat behavioural and medical issues. Once they're ready, snap a photo and start looking for their forever home!</p><h3 data-block-id="4ad7a67c-6f71-4dca-a7e3-c2c7e606bf9e">Gameplay</h3><p data-block-id="8f5944fa-8f2d-431a-a5a9-fc194348551d">Progressing through the tutorials, you unlock a usable workplace. Unlocking cages and enclosed yards to keep the fur-babies safe while letting them play. You can play with them yourself, throwing a ball for the dogs, and handling a laser pointer for cats to chase.</p><p data-block-id="c586bda9-5461-4097-b1a7-219326132e13">The animals need pats, play, food &amp; water, comfort items, cleaning and more. They often have specific desires at times, like being held or a selfie. Cats and needy doggos (Frenchies) love to be held in your arms while you walk around the shelter. You can also stick them on a leash and take them to the local park.</p><p data-block-id="c586bda9-5461-4097-b1a7-219326132e13">The game also has changing seasons, so the player needs to ensure their areas stay at a comfortable temperature. It gets real cold in winter and they can get sick easily.</p><p data-block-id="34e8be88-20de-4601-bea4-2f0556dce110">Ensure you fulfil their needs, complete specific 'breakpoint' tasks that halt their progression and interact with them regularly. If you do, they'll be ready for adoption!</p><p data-block-id="fe4e9221-9548-4573-88e3-8e821e0d08ff">When they're ready, take a photo, post an ad and sort through the applicants to find their perfect home. Each animal has behavioural traits that requires specific features to be present at their adoptive home. Conversely, they also have incompatible features they can't stand, or aren't safe with. The player needs to match the pet's desires with the adopter's home and their own desires or the match wont succeed.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/55/AnimalShelter2Pug-3.webp" alt="Game screenshot showing a pug dressed in a cowboy hat and leather vest" width="1920" height="1080" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/55/responsive/AnimalShelter2Pug-3-xs.webp 300w, https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/55/responsive/AnimalShelter2Pug-3-sm.webp 480w, https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/55/responsive/AnimalShelter2Pug-3-md.webp 768w, https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/55/responsive/AnimalShelter2Pug-3-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>Also you can dress them up...</figcaption></figure><p data-block-id="e01ad547-61e7-4578-8abd-6b417b290d60">At the end of each day you get reputation based on what you've accomplished. Levels unlock new shelter facilities, upgrades and a wider range of problems faced by the animals. Time progresses as you play, and you'll pass out and wake up next day if you don't manually sleep. Pierre doesn't help himself to your pockets in this one though.</p><p data-block-id="5c61d1d4-136c-41da-a5e1-1374f218c6a4">Eventually you get access to a clinic to treat sick animals and isolation to keep contagious pets separate. You need to buy and use testing equipment to diagnose them and sort a treatment plan. There's also an option to outsource to a vet later on.</p><p data-block-id="5c61d1d4-136c-41da-a5e1-1374f218c6a4">You can hire staff to take up some of the load maintaining their needs as well as volunteers that help with specific tasks. Staff have different ability levels, controlling the speed and quality of their work. Or if they even notice a task needs doing. Their jobs and priorities are highly configurable.</p><p data-block-id="72a17b81-a986-4c54-abb0-2255a58c1874">You also unlock a washing room for dogs to keep them clean while cats need regular brushing. During pre-release, dogs just stood there when being washed. The 1.0 release adds misbehaviour, so dogs will now decide to escape from time to time.</p><p data-block-id="6f4f47d5-208f-4aeb-a82a-bc786cfb5c1d">There will also be various missions that pop up. Some need you to drive out yourself and locate an abandoned pet. Others give you promotional opportunities to boost the rep and funding of the shelter.</p><h3 data-block-id="6477a8e0-7140-495a-8411-666fde056dc4">Tech</h3><p data-block-id="0b45eca5-61d4-4933-804a-ed7489f67c9f">The devs took the time to ensure the game volume wasn't set to 100% by default. As a streamer and headphones wearer, the effort is always greatly appreciated.</p><p data-block-id="985aa262-d1d7-4f74-8de4-7e32361f5c9a">The game itself ran well. The audio is chill and fits the game. The graphics are the familiar PlayWay art style, though noticeably improved. The animals have more detailed animations than the humans, as it should be.</p><p data-block-id="081ae8a0-8c1a-4172-93f2-76ada0c1c18f">Pre-release, there are some minor animation issues. Placing a pet on the ground can be a bit 'teleporty' sometimes. Filling a water bowl can snap the player's view to level while it fills. A dog chasing the ball can trigger a few rough animations before they chase it.</p><p data-block-id="96b00288-7db5-4923-b1ef-11209cd292f7">However the devs are actively updating the game and look to have greatly improved much of it already, ready for release.</p><h3 data-block-id="ab37773d-b4da-43da-8b1d-78f9ee1f6b2b">Recommendation</h3><p data-block-id="805a75d2-d4b4-4dff-bc9e-87bb2b4c1764">Doggos! Floofs! Play with them all and get that dopamine flowing. If you're into management simulators grab Animal Shelter 2 and support great devs making wholesome games.</p><ul><li data-block-id="805a75d2-d4b4-4dff-bc9e-87bb2b4c1764"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658510/Animal_Shelter_2/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Buy Animal Shelter 2 from Steam</a></li></ul></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 21 July 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety game streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
