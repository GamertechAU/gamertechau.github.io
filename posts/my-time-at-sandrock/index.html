Both the single- and multi-player modes.</p><p>My Time at Sandrock is a building and exploration game with plenty of story, relationships, combat and playstyles you can choose from. The world is a recovering post-apocalyptic society with pro-development scientists and the church which only allows the use of simple technology. Portia was really strict about technology, however Sandrock being on the frontier and struggling to survive is much more lenient.</p><p>You play a fresh new builder accepting a job offer to build for the people of Sandrock, gathering resources to craft requests for the townsfolk, as well as building important infrastructure for the town. In addition to your builder duties, you explore pre-war ruins, fight hostile mutants, grow crops, fish, discover and research technology and many other activities.</p><p>The NPC characters are well-written, successfully bringing to life an enjoyable story with plenty of main and side content to explore. At the time of playing there were some minor bugs where doing quests out of order would prevent access to others, however the devs were pretty on top of fixes.</p><p>The graphics were cute and cheerful, suiting the game well. The game did have some fps drops in some areas, particularly when the train's around. At the time of playing, also had a slow but noticeable memory leak which impacts the game around 11GB. It took several hours of gameplay to get it to that point however.</p><p>The multiplayer mode was a heavily accelerated take on the singleplayer, apparently set before the singleplayer timeline. With much of the story removed and the town much less developed, but some minor unique content added. Players work together to build the town up including areas and infrastructure that later exists in SP, including stairs, tunnels, the water tower etc. As well as completing co-op and personal tasks for locals.</p><p>I enjoyed Sandrock as I did Portia before it and highly recommend them both to prospective buyers. At the time of writing, Pathea is currently working on the next game, My Time at Evershine and is collecting funds via Kickstarter.</p></div><footer><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/a-plague-tale-requiem/" class="inverse" rel="prev">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/final-profit/" class="inverse" rel="next">Final Profit: A Shop RPG</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
