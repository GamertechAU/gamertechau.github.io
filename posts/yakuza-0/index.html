And what a game it is.&nbsp;Yakuza 0 will keep you busy for minimum 30 hours if you just focus the main story, a heck a lot more if you fully explore all the content the game has to offer.</p><p>The game introduces the dual main characters Kazama Kiryu and Majima Goro who are of course yakuza and will stick with the player through successive Yakuza games in different roles. The game takes place in 1980's Kamurochō, a city accurately recreated from the real-world&nbsp;Kabukichō in Shinjuku, Tokyo and Sotenbori aka Dōtonbori, Osaka. The player moves between them at different parts of the story.</p><p>Yakuza 0 is a beat-em-up with a quality and dramatic story with plenty of feels. Both characters have multiple fighting styles you unlock and expand during the story, and can freely switch between them mid-combat to suit your needs.</p><p>The world is full of engaging characters with real stories and brilliant voice actors. Keep in mind the game only has Japanese voices, no English except for a few words here and there.</p><p>Both cities are full of life and it's very easy to get distracted from the main story with all the substories and minigames throughout them. All of them have their own engaging stories and are well worth exploring. Some contribute to progression, such as unlocking new combat skills, while others are there purely for their story. The devs are experts at balancing a serious, deadly story with lighthearted, eccentric content.</p><p>The minigames include Yakuza's staple SEGA arcades where you can play old-school SEGA games, businesses you can develop and expand for story and income as well as traditional games such as riichi mahjong, disco and karaoke. You can also get (multiple) girlfriends and take them to said minigames on dates. Whatever you're interested in, there's plenty to keep you busy and enjoying it.</p><p>The game itself ran well and smoothly with no issues. All the Yakuza games are controller and it had no issues detecting it on PC.</p><p>Yakuza 0 is an amazing game made by devs that love their content. Can't recommend&nbsp; highly enough getting into the Yakuza series starting from this game.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 4 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/website/GamertechDP-128x.avif" loading="lazy" height="false" width="false" alt="GamertechAU"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
