The Crysis re-release amps up the graphic quality, adds limited raytracing and does it in a pretty smooth-running package. However, there's no shortage of issues and cut corners in this release.</p><p data-block-id="5b0cd68f-961f-498c-8403-9f45b8778899">Crysis involves you and your special ops team wearing advanced power armour deploying to a remote island. Your mission is to locate and extract some archaeologists requesting emergency support. Obviously, things don't go as planned and the place goes to heck.</p><p data-block-id="b5464cbc-51a1-457e-ac59-049bdf51edbf">While the game itself runs well and the remaster content is actually remastered, most of the games' settings don't get saved to config. They reset to default every time you restart the game or re-open the settings menu. That includes the ever-present motion blur that studios refuse to get rid of defaulting to enabled. Not all graphics were improved such as faces which are noticeably worse.</p><p data-block-id="7acc78b7-e821-4bc0-be03-4048ffd7b023">There's also a popup every time you launch the game warning about raytracing being disabled due to an incompatible driver. Instead of checking supported features which is best practice, or checking for a minimum driver version, Crytek seem to have just allow-listed the latest driver of the time. Any driver versions before or after that gets a warning. Also, despite the warning, raytracing doesn't actually get disabled, so even that doesn't work.</p><p data-block-id="2f665b0a-9cee-4a80-927a-3565bec671e4">Add to that, the enemy AI is...terrible. If the enemy aren't shooting at you, they're likely running around in circles, running into a wall or standing completely immobile. Often refusing to react to your presence until you shoot them first. Throw a grenade and they call it out, yet instead of running they stand still or cluster towards where it landed.</p><p data-block-id="cbd6f57f-4809-46a6-ba5e-7e2983fdbb27">The enjoyable stealth mechanics from the original Crysis no longer function. If you're not using the suit's cloaking mode, then the enemy sees you. Spend a few minutes slowly walking up behind a rock for a nice ambush location on unsuspecting enemies? Decloak and instantly "There! Shoot him!" with no sound or line of sight. As a stealthy boi, this is pretty game-breaking.</p><p data-block-id="bd23861f-0a27-4d61-b55f-9d425835d164">The destructible buildings are also pretty extreme now. A few pistol bullets, or the player walking into a wall causes the building to shatter into pieces. No real force required. As a bonus, the game often fails to render enemies, meaning you're getting shot by invisible soldiers.</p><p data-block-id="78294c08-549f-4e39-8ecf-05df1ec1de30">After the first stream of it, I went back and played the OG Crysis. While not perfect of course, none of these problems existed.</p><p data-block-id="6eb48f37-3ca2-4164-829e-1f35e3b38798">Crysis Remastered was not finished before release and contains critical gameplay and design bugs. Considering how long it's been, it's unlikely whether they'll ever be fixed. Right now, I can't recommend purchasing it, especially if you own the original.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 11 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/website/GamertechAU-2.webp" loading="lazy" height="false" width="false" alt="GamertechAU"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
