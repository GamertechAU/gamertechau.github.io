The protagonist (two choices, both named Dani Rojas) is engaging with solid voice actors. There's no character customisation available. The island chain of Yara has been taken over by a ruthless dictator focused on power and profit at all costs, including the players life of course. Predictably through a chain of events, the player is dragged into fighting back against the regime.</p><p>The side stories have good content and help fill in more of the lore as well as some silly, fun events to break the tension. The DLC's are unfortunately not worth it in my opinion. The added content is just not that great, especially for the price. Thankfully the game doesn't push you into the many micro-transactions (singleplayer game btw) which is nice.</p><p>Gameplay has decent exploration and combat. It's an Ubisoft game though so if you've seen the lookout/PoI system in one game, you've seen them all and there's lots and lots of climbing. There's also no shortage of content designed to just keep you in the game, even after you've completed the story.</p><p>Explore the open world and ambush soldiers who usually ignore you unless you start something. Capture checkpoints for loot and extra rebel support, capture bases to get stores/vehicle spawns etc.</p><p>There's a whole lot of vehicles and horses you can unlock though there's usually not much benefit to using them. There's tons of military vehicles available to divest of their owners, and plenty of guns and mods to adjust to your playstyle. Personally I'm a sneaky boi so I went a suppressed semi-auto marksman rifle. The actual sniper rifles were powerful but extremely limited ammo and didn't offer any benefit over shorter range guns. The Amigo's are fun. Cute and deadly pet companions that offer buffs to the player and generally eat everything you don't like. Chorizo is the bestest boi.</p><p>The game is stable and runs smoothly. The graphics are solid, though there's a slight blur filter over everything. The ray tracing is...kinda bad unfortunately. It was seemingly just tacked on to tick the box rather than properly integrated. It makes the game look slightly worse in the few cases it's noticeable and significantly impacts performance. The trade-off just isn't there. There's an integrated benchmark which helps you configure your settings though.</p><p>It definitely has its issues but if you're okay with the Ubisoft way of doing things then Far Cry 6 is a solid game with an engaging story and smooth gameplay. It gave many hours of content on stream and some light-hearted action between the...not-so light-hearted content (it gets real dark in parts).</p></div><footer><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/tag/completedgames/">Completed Games</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/final-fantasy-vii-intergrade/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Final Fantasy VII: Intergrade</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/yakuza-0/" class="inverse" rel="next">Yakuza 0</a></h3></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3>Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/area-51/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/12/responsive/Area51-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of Area 51"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-05-23T21:02">23 May 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/area-51/" class="inverse">Area 51</a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/11/responsive/SleepingDogsDefinitiveEdition-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-05-22T21:00">22 May 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition/" class="inverse">Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition</a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/3-out-of-10-season-two/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/9/responsive/3outof10Season2-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of 3 out of 10 Season Two"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-03-23T20:29">23 March 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/3-out-of-10-season-two/" class="inverse">3 out of 10 Season Two</a></h4></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
