<h3>Playthrough</h3>
<p>Been meaning to play this cute little puzzle game for a while now, and glad I did as it was excellent.</p>
<p>Lost in Play is a charming puzzle adventure game where you explore the imaginations of two siblings (Toto and Gal) as they play together, looking for a way back home. During the playthrough you'll encounter many unique characters who all have something to contribute to your adventure.</p>
<p>As you explore different areas, you find objects and how to use them point-and-click adventure style, and complete a large range of wild puzzles and minigames to further the story with plenty of well-done references throughout it.</p>
<p>It's completely family friendly and can be played using a controller, keyboard or mouse for easy preference and accessibility. It can also run on a potato while still having a fantastic and high quality art style.</p>
<p>Lost in Play ran perfectly with no technical issues. One gripe was the settings were inaccessible until you actually started the play through, with volume defaulting to 100%, so its loud with no opportunity to set it to a sane level before the opening cutscene.</p>
<p>Highly recommend giving Lost in Play a go if you're looking for a chill game that's slightly brain-melty. One playthrough took 4.8 hours on stream.</p>
