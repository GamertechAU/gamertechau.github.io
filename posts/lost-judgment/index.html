It features bullying and all the extremes that can result from that. I wont go into it in this article, but if you're sensitive to that content best to keep it in mind when considering this game.</p><p>The sequel to Judgment, you again play Takayuki Yagami, a (broke) semi-ex-lawyer turned private detective working with your buddy Masaharu Kaito and other characters you meet in Judgment. Functionally the Judgment series is very similar to Yakuza, however has a detective spin on it which is well-done and includes some new mechanics.</p><p>Games from this studio traditionally start with an epic opening scene to drop the player right into the action in an enjoyable way which Lost Judgment did too of course, however this game had a little surprise before that which I loved: an anime-style intro montage video with a heck of a beat. This imo is something I'd love a lot more games to do as it's one heck of a way to engage the player immediately, but alas one can dream.</p><p>Once you get past the intro, Yagami finds himself with seemingly minor PI work that builds into a deep and engaging story, plus the usual solid side-stories that are strong enough to support themselves and of course the light-hearted humour that Ryu Ga Gotoku is known for.</p><p>The map is extremely detailed featuring the staple Kamurocho, Tokyo as well as adding Ijincho, Yokohama, both modelled on real-world cities. There's content everywhere, plenty of restaurants, cafes and kiosks to sample and of course the ever-present girlfriends. It's easy to get lost for hours just exploring the side content.</p><p>The game has the usual minigame content including the SEGA arcades, but also features some major ones that integrate an optional but major side-story. Some of the bigger minigames could've had a bit more work put into them with the gameplay seeming a bit repetitive, but were still enjoyable.</p><p>The average public feeling about Lost Judgment seems to be that it's more technically advanced than Judgment, but the story wasn't as good. I agree that the game is noticeably more advanced however in my opinion the main stories of both games were excellent. I believe the above minigames let it down a bit, but they don't detract from the very real story in the game.</p><p>The combat is the staple Yakuza beat-em-up so is easy to slip into for experienced players with four stances to choose from. As you progress you can unlock improvements and new techniques for each stance, often through minigame content.</p><p>The game ran brilliantly on PC as expected from Ryu Ga Gotoku with a Platinum rating on ProtonDB. No crashes, stuttering or frame drops and the graphics as always were excellent.</p><p>All in all, I loved this game and (keeping in mind the content warning at the top) I highly recommend both Judgment and Lost Judgment. They're a solid spin-off from the world of Yakuza/Like a Dragon and stand on their own with a familiar world yet brand new unique stories.</p></div><footer><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" class="inverse" rel="prev">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/the-planet-crafter/" class="inverse" rel="next">The Planet Crafter</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
