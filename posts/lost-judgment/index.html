It features bullying and all the extremes that can result from that. I wont go into it in this article, but if you're sensitive to that content please keep it in mind when considering this game.</p><h3 id="plot">Plot</h3><p>The sequel to Judgment, you again play Takayuki Yagami. A (broke) semi-ex-lawyer turned private detective. Alongside his buddy Masaharu Kaito and other characters you meet in Judgment. Functionally the Judgment series is very similar to Yakuza, with a detective spin. The result is extremely well done and includes some fresh new mechanics.</p><h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3><p>Games from Ryu Ga Gotoku traditionally start with an epic opening scene to drop the player right into the action in an enjoyable way. Lost Judgment is no exception, however this game had a little surprise before that which I loved. An anime-style intro montage video with a heck of a beat. This is something I'd love a lot more games to do as it's a brilliant way to engage the player immediately, but alas one can dream.</p><p>Once past the intro, Yagami finds himself stuck with seemingly minor PI work. As you progress it builds into a deep and engaging story, plus the usual solid side-stories that are strong enough to support themselves. Of course all with the light-hearted humour that Ryu Ga Gotoku is known for.</p><p>The map is extremely detailed featuring the series staple Kamurocho, Tokyo as well as adding Ijincho, Yokohama, both modelled on real-world cities. There's content to be found everywhere. Plenty of restaurants, cafes and kiosks to sample and of course the ever-present girlfriends. It's easy to get lost for hours just exploring the side content.</p><p>Lost Judgment has the usual minigame content including the expected SEGA arcades. It also features some major ones that integrate into an optional but major side-story. Some of the bigger mini-games could've had a bit more work put into them. With several of them, the gameplay seemed a bit repetitive. Thankfully they were still enjoyable.</p><p>The average public feeling about Lost Judgment seems to be that it's more technically advanced than Judgment, but the story wasn't as good. I agree that the game is noticeably more advanced however in my opinion the main stories of both games were excellent. I believe the above minigames let it down a bit, but they don't detract from the very real story in the game.</p><p>The combat is the staple Yakuza beat-em-up so is easy to slip into for experienced players with four stances to choose from. As you progress you can unlock improvements and new techniques for each stance, often through mini-game content.</p><h3 id="tech">Tech</h3><p>The game ran brilliantly on PC as expected from Ryu Ga Gotoku with a Platinum rating on ProtonDB. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p><p>No crashes, stuttering or frame drops and the graphics as always were excellent.</p><h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3><p>All in all, I loved this game and (keeping in mind the content warning at the top) I highly recommend the Judgment series. They're a worthy spin-off from the world of Yakuza/Like a Dragon and stand on their own with a familiar world yet brand new unique stories.</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058190/Lost_Judgment/" target="_blank">Buy Lost Judgment on Steam</a></li></ul></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 22 July 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety game streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
