  <p>
    In a world full of half-assed Star Trek games focused on milking players' wallets rather making an actual game, Star Trek: Resurgence is a breath of fresh air. It brings back old-school Star Trek and respect for the science rather than the new movie magic stuff. (Prodigy and Lower Decks excluded. They're awesome).
  </p>

  <p>
    Developed by ex-Telltale devs, Resurgence is a choose-your-own-adventure game with an enjoyable story. Your choices actually matter. Some of those choices can be pretty hard, but all of them help guide the story and decide your ending.
  </p>

  <p>
    You play as two characters on the Centaur-class USS Resolute, swapping between them at different points in the story. The game has a similar relationship system to Telltale games and all the characters you interact with matter. The story itself is original and well crafted. Seamlessly linked to a previous canon mission of the Enterprise-D.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's different mini-game mechanics used throughout the game. This includes diplomacy, tricorder scanning for discovery/repair, piloting and phaser combat. Resurgence also includes talented voice actors including Jonathan Frakes reprising his role as Riker on the USS Titan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tech-wise, the game ran well. It was stable and well optimised which can unfortunately be hard to find these days. Choices have a timer, but I found many of them if the timer runs out the game will freeze until you make a decision. This reduces a lot of pressure and gives time to discuss them with chat.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're a fan of OG Star Trek, then this game is definitely one to pick up. I enjoyed every minute of it and it engaged (pun intended) chat extremely well.
