<h3>Playthrough</h3>
<p>Cat Quest II is a cute RPG where you play as a cat and dog royalty called to a world to defeat the evil kings and reclaim the land amidst a whole lotta cat/dog puns. It has optional co-op but I played solo for this playthrough.</p>
<p>You pounce around the open world map fighting enemies tag-teaming between the characters. The inactive character fights beside you as a secondary. As you explore you encounter chests holding new gear, or levels for existing gear as well as gold needed for upgrades. NPC's will also have side quests available with fun little stories and of course more puns.</p>
<p>As you play you unlock new armour and weapons all with different buffs to let you build your characters to suit your playstyle. You also can discover many different magic spells, being able to equip four at a time per character. The secondary character will use their spells automatically, though not always effectively.</p>
<p>As above, upgrading your gear and magic takes gold. A lot of it. While you can easily complete the game just from what you earn through normal gameplay, if you're a completionist, maxing out your gear will take a LOT of grinding.</p>
<p>Tech-wise the game ran extremely well with no graphical or performance issues however I had problems with the controller keybinds using my Xbox Elite. B is the interact button, however weirdly it also doubled as the dodge button which isn't intended. Talking to a quest giver causes you to roll away from them, and if you're too far away then the conversation freezes, preventing any further action in the game until you restart it. The game does allow keyboard rebinding, but not controller.</p>
<p>It's a fun game to explore by yourself or with friends. Apparently the controller issue was unusual, so don't expect to encounter it yourself. I got this game as an Epic freebie, however it's available on Steam as well, grab that bundle discount for all three games.</p>
