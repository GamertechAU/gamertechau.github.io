As you explore you can collect different slimes, bring them back to your ranch and keep them in corrals, feeding and family-friendly breeding them to create hybrids. You then collect their 'plorts' and sell them on the market. Other uses open up as you progress.</p><p>It's a sandbox game, so the objective is simply to progress your ranch and earn money while collecting limited lore scattered around the map. There are minor threats in game from the environment as well as some hostile slimes, but they don't really provide a challenge, more to add a bit to the 'life' as you explore.</p><p>The player gets free reign to build up their ranch as they see fit and can eventually add cosmetics to their slimes (with a DLC adding additional cosmetics). There's multiple distinct areas to unlock to expand your ranch that favour specific types of slimes and eventual automation.</p><p>The automation relies on drones you can research and construct then give them simple commands to auto-collect plorts, feed the slimes etc. In my opinion they could've been improved though. They only have enough fuel for one day of work, so each day you have to travel across your large farm to splash each drone base with water, or your slimes starve and riot, escaping their pens and creating chaos on the ranch.</p><p>One unfortunate point was the game contains one of the most restrictive stamina systems I've ever seen. Even with your stamina limit fully upgraded, you run out within seconds and as the game relies a lot on platforming using both running and a very anaemic jetpack that both rapidly consume it, you regularly have to stand still and wait for your energy to recharge before you can continue. Stamina systems are designed to slow the player down so the game lasts longer, but there was no actual need for it in Slime Rancher due to the plentiful sandbox content and is just a painful annoyance. There were mods that affect it on Nexus, but none of them seem to function any more unfortunately.</p><p>Performance, audio and art were all on point, with the game running perfectly with no stutters or frame drops.</p><p>Overall, I recommend Slime Rancher for a chill game session however the stamina issue really was extremely painful, so keep that in mind. Hopefully Slime Rancher 2 improves on it dramatically.</p></div><footer><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/wolfenstein-the-new-order/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
