You will however find the city of Kamurocho accurately modelled on the real-world Kabukicho, Tokyo still filled with content and Yakuza who mostly tend to not like you. It's not part of the Yakuza story, so can be played at any time without spoilers.</p><p>You play Takayuki Yagami, a semi-ex-lawyer turned private detective taking on jobs from the public along with his friend Masaharu Kaito, an ex-Yakuza member.</p><p>After the initial epic intro, you investigate minor jobs as well as seemingly unrelated tasks that lead to a major story as well as the main characters respective backstory. The story is deep, well-written and will keep the player engaged for hours.</p><p>But wait, what does that guy want? Included in Judgment is the huge amount of side stories you'll encounter all over while exploring. All of them have solid stories, many with the excellent and eccentric humour we've come to expect from this studio as well as several girlfriends you can take on dates and unlock additional story content.</p><p>In addition there's the staple Yakuza minigames including the SEGA arcades, but there's a brand new minigame type in Judgment, the drone races. Originally intended for detective work, you can mod out your drone for use in less-than-legal drone races through the streets of Kamurocho. It does seem slightly weighted to let the player win, however it's fun and adds a lot of enjoyable content.</p><p>The combat is the usual Yakuza-style system with two different combat stances Yagami can switch between, Tiger being intended for single-target combat while Crane is more efficient for groups. There are a large number of unlocks you can get to expand your combat abilities over time.</p><p>Judgment is built on the effective Dragon engine which means it looks pretty and it runs well, earning a Platinum playability rating on ProtonDB. The game also boasts an excellent soundtrack.</p><p>If you're a fan of the Yakuza series, I highly recommend grabbing Judgment and the sequel <a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/lost-judgment/">Lost Judgment</a>. They are excellent games and the series is a worthy spin-off that can easily stand on its own. Hopefully it continues alongside the Like a Dragon series.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 4 May 2025</p></aside><footer><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/tag/beat-em-up/">Beat em Up</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/tag/completedgames/">Completed Games</a></li></ul><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/final-profit/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Final Profit: A Shop RPG</a></h3></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" class="inverse" rel="next">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a></h3></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3>Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/3-out-of-10-season-one/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/8/responsive/3-out-of-10-season-one-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of 3 out of 10 Season One"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-03-21T19:59">21 March 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/3-out-of-10-season-one/" class="inverse">3 out of 10 Season One</a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/metro-2033-redux/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/10/responsive/Metro2033Redux-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of Metro 2033 Redux"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-03-31T20:55">31 March 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/metro-2033-redux/" class="inverse">Metro 2033 Redux</a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/area-51/"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/posts/12/responsive/Area51-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Game poster of Area 51"></a><figcaption><time datetime="2023-05-23T21:02">23 May 2023</time><h4><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/area-51/" class="inverse">Area 51</a></h4></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
