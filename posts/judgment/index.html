You will however find the city of Kamurocho accurately modelled on the real-world Kabukicho, Tokyo. Still filled with content and Yakuza who mostly tend to not like you. It's not part of the Yakuza timeline, so can be played at any time without spoilers.</p><h3 id="plot">Plot</h3><p>You play Takayuki Yagami, a semi-ex-lawyer turned private detective. Taking on jobs from the public along with his friend Masaharu Kaito, an ex-Yakuza member.</p><p>After the initial epic intro, you investigate minor jobs as well as seemingly unrelated tasks that lead to a major story. Also exploring the main characters respective backstory. The story is deep, well-written and will keep the player engaged for hours.</p><h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3><p>The base gameplay is similar to what you'd expect from the Yakuza series. Freely explore the city, talk to somewhat eccentric NPCs and unlock stories. When people inevitably get pissed at you, give them a rapid attitude adjustment to the face.</p><p>The combat is the usual Yakuza-style system with two different combat stances Yagami can switch between. Tiger being intended for single-target combat while Crane is more efficient for groups. There are a large number of unlocks you can get to expand your combat abilities over time.</p><p>But wait, what does that guy want? Included in Judgment is a huge amount of side stories you'll encounter all over while exploring. All of them have solid stories with the excellent and eccentric humour we've come to expect from this studio. Plus several prospective girlfriends you can take on dates with their own story content.</p><p>Sometimes suspects need to be tailed. Follow them through the streets and hide behind objects or blend into the crowd. There's also chase mechanics for when the bad guys don't want to be caught. Spy on people from a distance with a RC drone.</p><p>In addition there's the staple Yakuza minigames including the SEGA arcades. But there's also a brand new minigame type in Judgment, the drone races. Originally intended for detective work, you can mod out your drone for use in less-than-legal drone races through the streets of Kamurocho. The races are slightly weighted to let the player win, however it's fun and adds a lot of enjoyable content.</p><h3 id="tech">Tech</h3><p>Judgment is built on the proven Dragon engine which means it looks pretty and it runs well, earning a Platinum playability rating on ProtonDB. Also Steam Deck verified.</p><p>Judgment also boasts an excellent soundtrack that matches the atmosphere well.</p><h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3><p>If you're a fan of the Yakuza series, I highly recommend grabbing Judgment and the sequel <a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/posts/lost-judgment/">Lost Judgment</a>. They are excellent games and the series is a worthy spin-off that can easily stand on its own. Hopefully it continues alongside the Like a Dragon series.</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058180/Judgment/" target="_blank">Buy Judgment on Steam</a></li></ul></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 22 July 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety game streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
