You play a father employed as an underpaid high-school janitor who desperately needs an additional income source to pay for his daughters specialist (US) medical bills as the insurance company sure wont.</p><p>Doing a quick job helping out a 'friend' leads to a high-paying but extremely risky career cleaning up crime scenes and destroying evidence for a brutal mob leader. After 'Big Jim' is finished making a mess, your job is to go in, clean up the blood, bullet casings and of course bodies, clean and reposition all the furniture and remove any evidence of criminal activity at the site. Also any valuables as their previous owners no longer need them and you've got bills to pay.</p><p>As you progress, you earn skill points to unlock new tools and upgrades. You can leave maps partially completed, however the better the job you do, the more skill points you earn. Each map contains music tapes that unlock an in-game track and multiple secret areas with bonus loot and often an interesting story element. Once a map's completed, you can easily go back and do it again to find missed secrets and benefit from equipment upgrades.</p><p>I don't believe there's any failure state for the game as just completing the primary objectives on each map is enough to progress, though you will of course miss the completion bonus.</p><p>Tech-wise the game ran perfectly with no graphical, audio or performance issues and has a platinum rating on ProtonDB. The devs also took care of a pet peeve of mine and defaulted the audio to 50%, instead of blasting players with 100% volume.</p><p>If you're after a chill (and slightly creepy) cleaning sim, I definitely recommend Crime Scene Cleaner. The play through took 11 hours. Also, you can pat the doggo.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 1 June 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/website/GamertechAU.webp" loading="lazy" height="false" width="false" alt="GamertechAU"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
