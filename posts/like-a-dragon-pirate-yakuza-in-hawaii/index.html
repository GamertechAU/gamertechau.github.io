Seriously, it's that good. If you like the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, then get it. It's clear that the devs were allowed to have fun with it and it shows.</p><p>This is going to be tricky to explain without spoilers as there's so much unique content, all with RGG's staple well-balanced humour let off the leash a little to match the main character's wild personality, but I'll do my best!</p><p>Pirate Majima is a canon spin-off based after the events of LAD: Infinite Wealth (yes this game does have spoilers for IW, so play that first), you play long-time character Goro Majima who washes up on the beach of a tiny Hawaiian island having lost his memory (but not his booty kicking skills).</p><p>Through a traditionally chaotic series of events, Majima takes command of a pirate sailing ship and explores Hawaii in the search for fun, treasure and (eventually) his memories.</p><p>As you progress, you unlock crop and animal farming for obtaining cooking ingredients, ship upgrades, crew and customisation (more available from DLC), seemingly every minigame from previous Yakuza games plus new ones, music that you can play on your phone while sailing around and equipment that improves Majima's personal stats for on-foot combat.</p><p>While sailing, you'll encounter hostile ships and battle them for loot and crew xp and is a extremely well designed system. Entering combat is seamless, targeting requires you to pay attention to the waves that bob your ship around as well as other environmental factors. You can also swap to deck view and explore the deck on foot, revive fallen comrades, or repair status impairments.</p><p>Exploring on foot, you have the staple Yakuza real-time combat, not turn-based as in recent Like a Dragon games. With two stances to choose from, each focused on single-target or group combat and lots of skill upgrades purchasable using cash and reputation earned throughout the play through.</p><p>On day one release, the game ran perfectly out of the box with no crashes, stutters, performance issues etc. It was also extremely well optimised so didn't need upscaling/fake frames to get a playable frame rate. The audio was also excellent. RGG certainly put a lot of effort into this spin-off and it has me really looking forward to Project Century which looks to be an entirely new IP.</p><p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a seriously well-made game and if you're a fan of the series, is 100% a buy. Play through time with not-quite 100%'ing the game came to 47.7 hours.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 6 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety game streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
