Instead of the usual 1-2 main characters, this time they brought 4 to the table. Each of them bring their own story, mini-games and and substories. Their stories are of course all linked and contribute to the greater picture.</p><p>Like Yakuza 3, it's a simple remaster and port of the original PS3 game, not a modernised remake like Kiwami 1 &amp; 2. This means it's lacking many quality of life improvements. There's no sprint, in-progress substory locations aren't shown on the map, limited inventory size etc.</p><p>The combat is really where you notice the age. Each of the characters have their own style, though they're pretty similar. They also have their own skill tree which is limited compared to modern releases but gives a ton of moves. Heat actions can be difficult to trigger as enemies move before the prompt even appears. The characters attacks and combos tend to have a big delay after they finish, meaning you're standing there unable to dodge or defend yourself a lot.</p><p>While Yakuza 3 was known as "Blockuza" due to the majority of the enemies blocking more than attacking, Yakuza 4 features a large amount of stunlocks. Often you get hit once then locked into looped combo attacks and forced to watch as your health evaporates before you can finally dodge away. Staying nimble is recommended.</p><p>There's the usual range of mini-games present throughout the game including some new ones. Unfortunately the hostess gameplay is the same from Yakuza 3 which is...not good.</p><p>Graphics are upscaled PS3 graphics. Clean and spot on for the Yakuza series. The visual and audio design is excellent as always, perfectly matching the vibe. The game was also stable and ran perfectly with a Platinum rating on ProtonDB.</p><p>As always, if you're a fan of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, I recommend giving this one a go. While the game shows its age, the story never disappoints. Yakuza 5 Remastered coming soon!</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 16 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/website/GamertechAU-2.webp" loading="lazy" height="false" width="false" alt="GamertechAU"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
