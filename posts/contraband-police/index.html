The good kind of jank, not the broken mess type.</p><p>We played through the campaign mode on stream, working as a very underpaid police commander in charge of seemingly the only border checkpoint into the country ruled by a brutal dictatorship.</p><p>The main objective is to inspect vehicles and people coming into the country, ensure their paperwork is legit and they're not smuggling contraband. As you progress, story events happen to the country that affect what you need to look out for such as vehicle defects and forged documents, people coming from countries your bosses don't like and those pesky teachers and journalists...</p><p>If that's not enough, you also have to leave your post to transport seized contraband and prisoners across the country to storage or the labour camp where you have a (pretty much guaranteed) chance of getting ambushed by rebels on the road. Have to randomly leave to investigate crimes, intercept contraband drops with infinite waves of enemies (with no backup) etc. Plus you get intermittent rebel raids on the checkpoint forcing you to defend it (with backup).</p><p>During the game you can make choices to support the government or the rebels, guiding the story to one of the endings. There's also border crossers with urgent issues such as family emergencies, but almost always have invalid documents/vehicles. Whatever you choose with these, you get a letter either thanking or threatening you. You can choose to let them through, but apparently the government magically inspects their documents after they go through and fine you for it (though still lets them go). If you get anything wrong in an inspection, they fine you an amount depending on your level.</p><p>That brings us to the issues. One of them is an annoying bug with the vehicle defect system where you can look all over it and find absolutely everything wrong with it, and the audit says you missed something and fines you for it. For instance, if a vehicle has a front bumper and missing the rear one, you enter one bumper missing and the audit says two, or missing a body panel when the vehicle doesn't have any panels to be missing.</p><p>There's four choices of vehicles with different specialities such as speed or cargo transport. The fastest car seemed to have a collision mesh issue especially noticeable on dirt roads which made it really unstable, though not uncontrollable. The other vehicles were more stable.</p><p>As well as the campaign, there's two other game modes available, one a sandbox with no time limit, so just freeplay, the other is a challenge mode where you compete against other players on a leaderboard.</p><p>Graphically, the game uses the same art style common to PlayWay games. Not the prettiest, but clean and functional. As I progressed through the playthrough, the object culling got far more noticeable to the point I could park in front of the checkpoint's garage and it takes 10+ seconds for the garage to become visible. The collision mesh is there however so if you drive in and miss, you crash into invisible pillars.</p><p>Also playing on normal difficulty, I could happily stand still and fire at the enemies with pretty much zero risk of going down. The few times they do manage to hit you, it does almost no damage and heals pretty much instantly so there was no real risk unless you decided to stand on a grenade unfortunately.</p><p>Overall, I do recommend Contraband Police. It's a fun game with plenty of content, though the country really should hire more than one police officer. One person managing all this at once is problematic. One campaign playthrough on stream hit 14.2 hours so plenty of content inside.</p></div><footer><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://gamertechau.github.io/posts/crysis-remastered/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Crysis Remastered</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://gamertechau.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
