Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is a extremely engaging action-adventure game.</p><p>You play as Wei Shen. An undercover Hong Kong police officer tasked with infiltrating the Sun On Yee, part of the Triad. Wei must balance his duty as an officer with his survival in the gang and many times the lines get blurred.</p><p>Explore a small segment of Hong Kong with side quests to find all over the map. Beat up gangs, catch drug dealers and investigate street racers for the police. While at the same time maintaining your cover as a criminal and pushing your way up the ranks of the Triad. Shake down civilians, take down rivals and otherwise do things the police don't appreciate.</p><p>The main story is brilliant and well written. Competently showing Wei's struggles balancing the two lives, while exploring the inner workings and rivalries of the Sun On Yee organisation.</p><p>Combat usually involves unarmed combat, but the player also has access to guns and melee weapons. Sometimes even heavily armed vehicles. You can also train with Wei's old martial arts master to improve your skills and gain new techniques.</p><p>Tech-wise the game ran well, however it does have a windowing issue on launch. If you launch in fullscreen on a modern OS it tends to fail. Need to edit the config to windowed mode, launch then you can change it to fullscreen in game. Make sure you change it back to windowed before you quit out. The graphics quality and soundtrack are great and suit the game well.</p><p>Highly, highly recommend grabbing this game. It has excellent gameplay and an exceptionally written story. With completing most optional content, it took around 50 hours on stream.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 4 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://www.gamertechau.com/media/website/GamertechDP-128x.avif" loading="lazy" height="false" width="false" alt="GamertechAU"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
