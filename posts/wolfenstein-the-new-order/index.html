For younger viewers this is a mature-rated game with lots of dark scenes so keep that in mind.</p><p>In an alternate 1946, you play William Blazkowicz, a US operative sent in to eliminate a mad scientist powering the bad guy regime by any means necessary. In an unfortunate series of events, you're seriously injured and taken out of the fight for 14 years. Long enough for the baddies to take over the world.</p><p>Finally recovered in 1960, your objective is to find any remaining resistance and fight back against the oppressors utilising a variety of firearms and firearm-adjacent weaponry. Also knives. There's lots of sharp objects used in this game. Not always in ways you want.</p><p>The story is excellent and takes you to multiple countries, the playable maps while simpler in layout than OG Wolfenstein easily puts modern AAA(A) map design to shame with multiple routes to choose from including the requisite sneaky-boi paths and verticality regularly comes into play. As Star Wars taught us, the high ground matters. There's also plenty of secrets and collectables should you explore.</p><p>During the playthrough, you encounter a range of characters including resistance members, civilians, victims of the regime as well as really easy-to-hate members of said regime. The voice acting is excellent and were well-cast in my opinion.</p><p>One annoying design choice was that the game consistently takes half your weapons and almost all of your ammunition at the start of each mission, even ones Will knows about well in advance and has plenty of time to prepare. There's plenty of ammo all over of course, however it does seem a bit of a weird choice that he'd knowingly go into battle with a single mag.</p><p>The graphics were great, however there was a pretty extreme depth-of-field layer that can't be turned off without using the console, and it's noticeable why that is, as asset pop-in is extremely obvious when disabled and looking around. Unfortunately it's a shortcoming that does detract from the experience, though at least in more open maps, the pop-in isn't really noticeable. It's earned a Platinum rating on ProtonDB.</p><p>If you're into complex FPS shooter games with solid stories (and over the age rating), I highly recommend giving Wolfenstein: The New Order a go. Got around 9.5 hours of playtime on stream.</p></div><aside><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 4 May 2025</p></aside><footer><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://www.gamertechau.com/authors/gamertechau/" class="inverse" title="GamertechAU">GamertechAU</a></h3><p>GamertechAU is a part-time variety game streamer and can be found streaming live on Twitch.
