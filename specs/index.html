Fedora is one of the best Linux distros for gaming/streaming and far more efficient. Leading to higher framerate, smoother frametimes and far more enjoyable game sessions. Also, no spyware.</p><p>KDE Plasma is the most modern desktop&nbsp;environment available, hugely customisable and extremely gaming-friendly. Not to mention an almost 1:1 layout to the Windows desktop so an extremely easy transition into the 21st century.</p><h3 id="cpu-amd-ryzen-9-5900x-12c24t">CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12c/24t</h3><p>Solid little powerhouse from AMD. Cool, quiet and efficient. Not as fast as the 5800X3D in gaming and single-threaded tasks, but with its 12 cores/24 threads outclasses it in multi-tasking (like gaming and streaming on the one PC). AMD's drivers are also built into Linux, so they're plug n' play, with no need to install drivers ever again.</p><p>My stream is encoded on the CPU and doesn't break a sweat while gaming at the same time.</p><h3 id="motherboard-msi-mag-x570-tomahawk-wifi">Motherboard: MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk Wifi</h3><p>Probably the peak bang-for-buck performance motherboard of the generation. Has almost all the main features you'd require from an enthusiast board (10Gb when?) and extremely stable on the latest BIOS.</p><h3 id="ram-2x16gb-gskill-tridentz-3866mhz-c14">RAM: 2x16GB G.Skill TridentZ 3866MHz C14</h3><p>G.Skill makes pretty much the best enthusiast RAM out there. Not really any contest. High performance components and extensive compatibility testing with board manufacturers. In my case these are stock 3600C16 sticks, but I've overclocked them to the sweet spot for Zen 3 CPU's.</p><h3 id="graphics-powercolor-rx-7900-xt-red-devil-20gb">Graphics: PowerColor RX 7900 XT Red Devil 20GB</h3><p>Intended as an upsell card for the much pricier 7900 XTX, the 7900 XT isn't quite as fast stock, however it can handle any game you throw at it. AMD CPU's and GPU's auto-boost themselves within their thermal and power envelope. Upgrade the cooling and up the power limit and it easily takes on the XTX. I use this graphics card to record the stream in higher quality AV1 at the same time as gaming.</p><h3 id="aio-arctic-liquid-freezer-iii-360-black">AIO: Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 Black</h3><p>Currently one of the most efficient All-In-One liquid cooling setups and cheaper than some air coolers. While the fans it comes with are quiet and effective, I've swapped them to more powerful Phanteks T30's. The Ryzen can boost itself freely with no chance of overheating. Also comes with a fan module on the CPU heatsink to cool the surrounding VRM's.</p><h3 id="system-drive-samsung-980-pro-2tb-nvme">System Drive: Samsung 980 Pro 2TB NVMe<br></h3><p>Pricey but fast and reliable. PCI-E Gen 4 means there's no holdups on loading screens. Also includes a cache to ensure it doesn't get bogged down on large transfers. It uses SLC-based chips which means it has a much higher write durability than a cheaper TLC/QLC-based SSD. This one's used to install the OS and all general-use programs.</p><h3 id="games-drive-western-digital-black-sn850x-4tb-nvme">Games Drive: Western Digital Black SN850X 4TB NVMe</h3><p class="msg msg--warning">Important: Ensure you're running an updated firmware. The launch firmware caused rapid death of the SSD.</p><p>Once you're past that, it works well. Fast and great for a dedicated gaming drive. Not much else to say about it. Steam, Heroic, RetroArch and all other games/launchers install to this drive.</p><h3 id="nic-intel-x520-da2-10gb-sfp-fibre-nic">NIC: Intel X520-DA2 10Gb SFP+ Fibre NIC<br></h3><p>1GbE copper networking is so yesterday. This stream runs on 10Gb OM4 Multimode fibre to the network rack to ensure there's no interruptions. Lower power consumption and no interference, plus a whole lot more bandwidth for large file transfers and multi-tasking. Had to use a PCI-E extension cable and vertical mount to fit it as the graphics card ate up the slot and motherboard manufacturers still refuse to add SFP+ ports.</p><p>Also need to use Intel-flashed SFP+ modules as the X520 unfortunately has a whitelist of compatible modules, but FS Intel modules, or a kernel argument to bypass it fixes that.</p><h3 id="monitors-3x-27-samsung-odyssey-g5-1440p144">Monitors: 3x 27" Samsung Odyssey G5 1440p144</h3><p>Three shiny curved monitors pictured at the top of the page. 2560x1440 resolution at 144Hz is perfect for gaming and general use. I game in native resolution and downscale it to 1080p for stream. Only has one button, so controls aren't ideal and the "HDR"...isn't, but Freesync ensures no tearing, ever.</p><p>Are three monitors really enough though? 🤔<br></p><h3 id="microphone-harman-akg-p220">Microphone: Harman AKG P220</h3><p>Solid professional vocals XLR mic. Bit of a pricey choice for someone just starting out, but excellent audio quality. Do note this isn't a directional microphone. By default it will pick up absolutely everything in great detail, so you will need to put some time into tuning the interface and OBS filters to limit it to your voice. Requires phantom power provided by the below Focusrite.</p><h3 id="mic-interface-focusrite-scarlett-2i2-gen-3">Mic Interface: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Gen 3</h3><p>A USB-C powered XLR microphone/instrument interface. Provides phantom power to the mic and has different modes to bring the best out of instruments and vocals. Plug and play on Linux. The 2i2 has two ports for dual-mics or playing instruments at the same time.</p><h3 id="headphones-beyerdynamic-dt-900-pro-x">Headphones: Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X</h3><p>Oh. Oh yes. These are nice. They do have round earcups, so if you have longer ears these will NOT be suitable, but for me they're comfortable for long streaming sessions. Extremely high quality audio and can be powered off a basic amped PC sound chipset. Do not use a high power DAC, you'll blow them out (and void the warranty). Can hear games in precise detail and works well if you want to run virtual surround.</p><p>They are open-backed headphones so are intended for quiet environments. Open-style headphones increase the audio quality noticeably, however you will hear everything going on around you, also everyone around you will hear what you're hearing. Quiet rooms where you're not going to disturb anyone only.</p></div></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2024 - 2025 GamertechAU</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.gamertechau.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
