It can be a bit of a shock to the system.</p>\n<p>Putting that aside, the story is of course up to RGG's excellent standard. A bit darker than the story in 0-2 it still has the depth and feels players know and love. Continuing off the story of Yakuza 2, we find Kiryu retired in Okinawa, Japan running an orphanage. It's a peaceful life until the Fire Na...uh... Yakuza attack.</p>\n<p>Kiryu then gets called out of retirement and is immediately back to punching people in the search for some peace and quiet. During the playthrough, you meet a lot of old friends, plus new ones. Everyone's a little older with new stories and a ton of substories, which are back to their usual lengths and depth compared to the much shorter ones in 2.</p>\n<p>Combat is simultaneously simpler and more complex. Enemies actually block or dodge, and have no trouble landing the hurt. The AI of Gun-wielding enemies is extremely limited. Generally they just stand there harmlessly unless you give them a long enough chance to do something. Using heat actions or grabs can be a bit painful as they're very picky about where you need to stand, how long you need to stand still and the option often vanishes before the enemy even starts moving out of the way.</p>\n<p>The lack of QoL features in this older game is highly noticeable, though thankfully doesn't detract from the story. You can't sprint outside of the chase minigame unlike previous games which is definitely noticeable as you have to run across town regularly. You can only order one thing at a time at restaurants/cafes/bars etc which makes it extremely slow if you're trying to complete the 'eat everything' achievements or heal a lot of health. The camera control is pretty annoying moving in tight spaces and especially combat. Inventory is back to limited slots and fills up extremely quickly.</p>\n<p>The game looks solid for the PS3 era and ran smoothly with no performance issues.</p>\n<p>If you're a fan of the Yakuza series, I highly recommend giving Yakuza 3 a go. Hopefully it'll get a Kiwami remake eventually, though at the time of writing, RGG's busy with Pirate Majima and Project Century, so might be a while.</p>",

Well worth playing.</p>\n<p>You play Albert Wilde, a broke feline private investigator in a noir prohibition-era US world of anthropomorphic animals who, in an effort to get a little scratch, stumbles on a big case that leads you around the city engaging with multiple interesting characters.</p>\n<p>Upfront, the game isn't intended to be a brain-melting investigation. The game focuses on the story and dry humour, so the investigative part of it is pretty simple. From their Steam page, the devs describe it as \"...something between a walking simulator and an interactive novel, with a strong emphasis on comedy\".</p>\n<p>The game is fairly linear. You can freely explore unlocked areas, however you can't progress with the story until you find all the key items or dialogue in that stage and it's extremely difficult to get lost. If you do, there's an effective journal in the form of actual notes written by Albert to point you where you need to go.</p>\n<p>It is a fairly short game. The devs state 6-7 hours, it took me 5.5 with talking to chat mixed in. Tech-wise it ran perfectly. One gripe is the game settings are only available after starting a new game and progressing past a reasonably loud opening cutscene with all the volume bars set default to 100%. Not ideal for a stream or headphones users. Settings should be available immediately, and volume should default to ~50% to allow players to adjust it without being deafened. It leaves an impression.</p>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed the play through and recommend checking it out.</p>",

The good kind of jank, not the broken mess type.</p>\n<p>We played through the campaign mode on stream, working as a very underpaid police commander in charge of seemingly the only border checkpoint into the country ruled by a brutal dictatorship.</p>\n<p>The main objective is to inspect vehicles and people coming into the country, ensure their paperwork is legit and they're not smuggling contraband. As you progress, story events happen to the country that affect what you need to look out for such as vehicle defects and forged documents, people coming from countries your bosses don't like and those pesky teachers and journalists...</p>\n<p>If that's not enough, you also have to leave your post to transport seized contraband and prisoners across the country to storage or the labour camp where you have a (pretty much guaranteed) chance of getting ambushed by rebels on the road. Have to randomly leave to investigate crimes, intercept contraband drops with infinite waves of enemies (with no backup) etc. Plus you get intermittent rebel raids on the checkpoint forcing you to defend it (with backup).</p>\n<p>During the game you can make choices to support the government or the rebels, guiding the story to one of the endings. There's also border crossers with urgent issues such as family emergencies, but almost always have invalid documents/vehicles. Whatever you choose with these, you get a letter either thanking or threatening you. You can choose to let them through, but apparently the government magically inspects their documents after they go through and fine you for it (though still lets them go). If you get anything wrong in an inspection, they fine you an amount depending on your level.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the issues. One of them is an annoying bug with the vehicle defect system where you can look all over it and find absolutely everything wrong with it, and the audit says you missed something and fines you for it. For instance, if a vehicle has a front bumper and missing the rear one, you enter one bumper missing and the audit says two, or missing a body panel when the vehicle doesn't have any panels to be missing.</p>\n<p>There's four choices of vehicles with different specialities such as speed or cargo transport. The fastest car seemed to have a collision mesh issue especially noticeable on dirt roads which made it really unstable, though not uncontrollable. The other vehicles were more stable.</p>\n<p>As well as the campaign, there's two other game modes available, one a sandbox with no time limit, so just freeplay, the other is a challenge mode where you compete against other players on a leaderboard.</p>\n<p>Graphically, the game uses the same art style common to PlayWay games. Not the prettiest, but clean and functional. As I progressed through the playthrough, the object culling got far more noticeable to the point I could park in front of the checkpoint's garage and it takes 10+ seconds for the garage to become visible. The collision mesh is there however so if you drive in and miss, you crash into invisible pillars.</p>\n<p>Also playing on normal difficulty, I could happily stand still and fire at the enemies with pretty much zero risk of going down. The few times they do manage to hit you, it does almost no damage and heals pretty much instantly so there was no real risk unless you decided to stand on a grenade unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Overall, I do recommend Contraband Police. It's a fun game with plenty of content, though the country really should hire more than one police officer. One person managing all this at once is problematic. One campaign playthrough on stream hit 14.2 hours so plenty of content inside.</p>",

However, there's no shortage of issues and cut corners in this release.</p>\n<p>Crysis involves you and your special ops team wearing advanced power armour deploying to a remote island to locate and extract some archaeologists who called for emergency support. Obviously, things don't go as planned and the place goes to heck.</p>\n<p>While the game itself runs well and the remaster content is actually remastered, most of the games' settings don't get saved to config. They reset to default every time you restart the game or re-open the settings menu. That includes the ever-present motion blur that studios refuse to get rid of defaulting to enabled.</p>\n<p>There's also a popup every time you launch the game warning about raytracing being disabled due to an incompatible driver as instead of checking for supported features which is best practice, or checking for a minimum driver version, they seem to have just whitelisted the latest driver of the time and any before or after that gets a warning. Also, despite the warning, raytracing doesn't actually get disabled, so even that doesn't work.</p>\n<p>Add to that, the enemy AI is...terrible. If the enemy aren't shooting at you, they're likely running around in circles, running into a wall or standing completely immobile, refusing to react to your presence until you shoot them. Throw a grenade and they call it out, however instead of running they stand still or cluster towards where it landed.</p>\n<p>The enjoyable stealth mechanics from the original Crysis no longer function. If you're not using the suit's cloaking mode, then the enemy sees you. Spend a few minutes slowly walking up behind a rock for a nice ambush location on unsuspecting enemies? Decloak and instantly \"There! Shoot him!\" with no sound or line of sight. As a stealthy boi, this is pretty game-breaking.</p>\n<p>The destructible buildings are also pretty extreme now. A few pistol bullets, or just the player walking into a wall and the building collapses. Violently. No force required. As a bonus, the game sometimes fails to render enemies, meaning you're getting shot by invisible soldiers.</p>\n<p>After the first stream of it, I went back and played the OG Crysis. While not perfect of course, none of these problems existed.</p>\n<p>While the graphics are pretty as expected (except faces which are noticeably worse), the game itself was not finished before release and contains critical gameplay and design bugs and it's unknown at the time of writing whether they'll be fixed. Right now, I can't recommend purchasing it, especially if you own the original.</p>",

It has optional co-op but I played solo for this playthrough.</p>\n<p>You pounce around the open world map fighting enemies tag-teaming between the characters. The inactive character fights beside you as a secondary. As you explore you encounter chests holding new gear, or levels for existing gear as well as gold needed for upgrades. NPC's will also have side quests available with fun little stories and of course more puns.</p>\n<p>As you play you unlock new armour and weapons all with different buffs to let you build your characters to suit your playstyle. You also can discover many different magic spells, being able to equip four at a time per character. The secondary character will use their spells automatically, though not always effectively.</p>\n<p>As above, upgrading your gear and magic takes gold. A lot of it. While you can easily complete the game just from what you earn through normal gameplay, if you're a completionist, maxing out your gear will take a LOT of grinding.</p>\n<p>Tech-wise the game ran extremely well with no graphical or performance issues however I had problems with the controller keybinds using my Xbox Elite. B is the interact button, however weirdly it also doubled as the dodge button which isn't intended. Talking to a quest giver causes you to roll away from them, and if you're too far away then the conversation freezes, preventing any further action in the game until you restart it. The game does allow keyboard rebinding, but not controller.</p>\n<p>It's a fun game to explore by yourself or with friends. Apparently the controller issue was unusual, so don't expect to encounter it yourself. I got this game as an Epic freebie, however it's available on Steam as well, grab that bundle discount for all three games.</p>",

They have good stories, they're just over too soon and lack any sort of impact to the world aside from experience. There just wasn't enough in each to get invested.

Two major side-stories bring back some old favourite characters and integrate them well.</p>\n<p>Overall, really enjoyed the game and it was perfectly playable on modern hardware. The substories are a bit of a let down but they don't detract from the main game at all. If you're into the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, don't miss this one.</p>",

If you're into detective-style content like Ace Attorney then this is one to pick up.</p>",

The tech behind the game hasn't aged too well, but the gameplay is still solid.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You play a fresh recruit of the elite First Encounter Assault Recon group that handles supernatural threats. You're tasked with investigating and stopping a violent incident involving a private military company's research program.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The mission predictably doesn't go well and the player is dragged into an increasingly dangerous story where there's more than what there seems. There's a range of weapons you can pick up during the game, however you can only hold 3 at a time. Ammo and health can be pretty limited depending on the difficulty setting.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Playing it on Linux, most of the required fixes such as widescreen support and 60 fps lock are applied automatically. Windows users however will need to hit up the PCGamingWiki for their fixes. Once you're done though, the game will run fine.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    While the 'horror' aspect unfortunately didn't have the impact it did back when I first played it back in 2005, the story was still engaging and the combat AI provided a decent threat.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Fighting through the halls with limited health, soldier clones trying to kill you and psychic horrors being streamed to your brain was an enjoyable experience. I recommend a playthrough for fans of horror shooters.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Note: Both Steam and GoG versions still have active SecuRom rootkit...uh...DRM. It doesn't affect Linux, however Windows users will have SecuRom installed (but not run thanks to driver enforcement) and it wont be uninstalled when removing the game.\n  </p>",

While shorter than Yakuza 0 there's no lack of content to experience. The Yakuza Kiwami remake brings freshly recorded voice lines, upgraded graphics and engine and makes full use of it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The main story is engaging with all the twists, turns and feels you can expect from a Ryu Ga Gotoku game. As always, the game environment of&nbsp;Kamurochō is highly detailed and accurately modelled on its real-world counterpart of&nbsp;Kabukichō.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One thing the Yakuza series excels at is filling out the world with content aside from the main story. The substories are deep with characters that matter and contribute to the world, there's tons of achievements/challenges and minigames everywhere including the staple SEGA arcades. If you want to just main the story quest you'll enjoy it, however the player is surrounded by a ton of extra content that's ready to explore.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The game runs perfectly on modern hardware. There are a few minor changes that would improve it, such as removing the long pauses after finishing combat, bumping into objects and after voice interactions with NPC's. Generally taking control from the player is less than ideal, but it doesn't interfere with the gameplay itself, just a frequent annoyance.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A Yakuza game from these devs, you're going to enjoy it. It's full of enjoyable content with stories that mean something. If you're into the Yakuza series, dive on in.\n  </p>",

You can read about <a href=\"https://gamertechau.github.io/posts/final-profit/\">the first run&nbsp;here</a>. Manabrent released the 1.2.3 update which came with a new optional roguelike game mode, Just Shop Mode(JSM). Of course, I had to give it a go.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As the name suggests, instead of having access to everything in the game like in the base mode, you get just the Enterpriston store and gain access to new products to sell and customers to buy them via roguelike unlock mechanics that change the run every time. Customers only buy certain products, so you have to adjust your tactics to what's available.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There's configurable choices when starting the mode that affect the difficulty, and directly control how many products, customers and buffs you can unlock. Even picking the 'Normal' difficulty choices, the new mode was challenging. Looking at you tax-man...\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Being a stripped-down game mode, JSM has minimal story however still strongly rewards exploration and progression. There's lots to find including new puzzles and secrets, and multiple additional unique endings. An entire room full of unlocks, upgrades and tweaks you can make to your customers, products and store. Plenty of customisation options to make the store your own and can still choose between generous and ruthless game styles.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If you liked the base game mode, definitely give the JSM game mode a go.\n  </p>",
